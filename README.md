# Hacker News: Mark All Read

This is the source code for the Firefox extension [Hacker News: Mark All Read](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hacker-news-mark-all-read/) (Add-on under review).
This is based on the Chrome extension by Daniele Mazzini, [source code here](https://github.com/danmaz74/HNMarkAllRead)

## Saving Time on Hacker News
### What danmaz74 says:
I created this extension out of my own frustration: I was bored at having to always scan the whole list of news on the HN home page to find
which one were actually new. I got a lot from the community, so I decided to take the time to polish the project a little and share it with
everybody else who will find it useful. Enjoy!

### What GMouron says:
I was having the same frustrations. I was also frustrated this was done for Chrome and not for Mozilla Firefox, so I decided to convert it.
Most of the code is the same as danmaz74. Modifications aimed at correct javascript execution and a few styling differences.
